# Event-Me-NLP

Front End:
This is the frontend of EventMe. Here you are going to get the .apk file to unstall our app. We used Android Studio and recommend opening with Androrid Studio. Android Studio has a very own way managing files so its shows the best structure possible. The layout file show how we structured our app and the java files hold all of our functionallity.
