# Event-Me-NLP

# Front End:
This is the frontend of EventMe. Here you are going to get the eventme.apk file directly above to install our app. We used Android Studio and recommend opening with Android Studio. Android Studio has a very own way managing files so its shows the best structure possible. Please use the FrontEnd branch to download the project. The layout file show how we structured our app and the java files hold all of our functionallity.
